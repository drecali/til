# `[DevTools]` - Show console timestamps

This seems obvious but not everyone knows it yet and I didn't learn it as early as I would have liked.

Timestamp information can be really useful, especially during more extensive debugging. If your debugging session gets interrupted, it's easy to recover where you left off. Especially if the `preserve logs` option is checked, it's good to have timing information. If you're trying a lot of debugging options and logging an output, sometimes an earlier approach is the best one. Timestamps can help jog your memory about the (sometimes) convoluted debugging journey.

I don't think they're enabled in Chrome by default so here's how to do it:

- Open your console.
- Select the topmost gear icon. This should open the DevTools Settings and show the `Preferences` tab.
- Scroll to the `Console` section.
- Ensure the `Show timestamps` preference is checked.
- Profit ðŸ¤‘
