# `[Library]` - Easy resizable elements with no dependencies

The library [re-resizable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/re-resizable) is a simple and lightweight library that allows you to resize elements. It's easy to use, has [great docs](https://github.com/bokuweb/re-resizable), no dependencies, and is actively maintained (as of 2024 06). I used it at work and it made my life easier so I fully recommend it. ðŸ™‚

There's even a [Storybook](https://bokuweb.github.io/re-resizable/?path=/story/aspect--default) of different use cases.

Full disclosure: It's the only library I tried for this feature so I can't say it's the best. I just know it worked really well in my situation. Hope it helps!
