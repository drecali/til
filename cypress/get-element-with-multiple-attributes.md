# Get element with multiple attributes

Usually when using the Cypress `get()` command, one attribute is enough to target an element, but it's possible to use more than one attribute too!

This is useful when targeting an element that's generated by a framework or library and can't receive a custom `id` or `data-` attribute.

Given these elements:

```html
<!-- Select this -->
<div class="tab container rounded" tabindex="-1"></div>

<!-- DO NOT select these -->
<div class="tab container rounded" tabindex="0"></div>
<div class="container rounded" tabindex="-1"></div>
```

The first element can be selected like this:

```js
cy.get('.tab[tabindex="-1"]');
// OR
cy.get('[tabindex="-1"].tab');
```

Cypress uses the jQuery multiple attribute selector documented [here](https://api.jquery.com/multiple-attribute-selector/).

Here is the syntax:

```js
cy.get("[attributeFilter1][attributeFilter2][attributeFilterN]");
```

üö® Note: **NO** spaces are allowed between `attributeFilter`s.

Here are the basic rules:

- It matches elements that match every `attributeFilter`.
- `attributeFilter` order does not matter.
- HTML attributes like `class` or `id` don't need square brackets. They can use the usual CSS/JS shorthand of `.class` and `#id`. There is a big difference between the square brackets and shorthand behavior. This will be addressed in a different note.
- The HTML `element` type also doesn't use square brackets.
  - However, it can't be appended to an `attributeFilter` that does't use square brackets (like `class` or `id`) because the `element` type would be interpreted as part of the `attributeFilter` string.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="tab container rounded" tabindex="-1"></div>
<span class="tab container rounded" tabindex="-1"></span>
```

```js
// ‚úÖ This works
cy.get("div.tab");

// ‚ùå This DOES NOT work because it's interpreted as `class="tabdiv"`
cy.get(".tabdiv");
```
