# `[Extension]` - GitLens is a must

I've seen the [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) extension every time I've looked at a developer's IDE. It's super useful and open source too!

It has a **ton** of features but one of the most noticeable is the subtle in-line `git blame` info. It only shows for the line where your cursor is. The contrast is low so it doesn't stand out, but when you need to know who last changed a line of code you'll know!

If you hover on this `git blame` info it shows more details including a commit hash, links to GitHub (and the PR), the `diff` for that line, and more.

Another favorite is all the views it adds to the `Git` panel in VS Code.

The File History view shows all the PRs that affected the current file.

The Stashes View is one of my favorites. It allows you to view, apply, or delete stashes.

Revision Navigation is awesome too! You can go forward or back in the current file's history.
