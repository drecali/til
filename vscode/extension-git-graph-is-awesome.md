# Git Graph is awesome!

[Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph) is one of my favorite VS Code extensions. It makes it easy to visualize your Git graph and run most `git` CLI actions like inspecting diffs, cherry-picking, tagging, merging, stashing, applying stash, reverting, etc.

It's awesome and free! I highly recommend downloading it.

Git is notoriously difficult and confusing (especially for beginners), so this intuitive tool is much appreciated.

The list of features is comically long!

- Git Graph View:
  - Display:
    - Local & Remote Branches
    - Local Refs: Heads, Tags & Remotes
    - Uncommitted Changes
  - Perform Git Actions (available by right clicking on a commit / branch / tag):
    - Create, Checkout, Delete, Fetch, Merge, Pull, Push, Rebase, Rename & Reset Branches
    - Add, Delete & Push Tags
    - Checkout, Cherry Pick, Drop, Merge & Revert Commits
    - Clean, Reset & Stash Uncommitted Changes
    - Apply, Create Branch From, Drop & Pop Stashes
    - View annotated tag details (name, email, date and message)
    - Copy commit hashes, and branch, stash & tag names to the clipboard
  - View commit details and file changes by clicking on a commit. On the Commit Details View you can:
    - View the Visual Studio Code Diff of any file change by clicking on it.
    - Open the current version of any file that was affected in the commit.
    - Copy the path of any file that was affected in the commit to the clipboard.
    - Click on any HTTP/HTTPS url in the commit body to open it in your default web browser.
  - Compare any two commits by clicking on a commit, and then CTRL/CMD clicking on another commit. On the Commit Comparison View you can:
    - View the Visual Studio Code Diff of any file change between the selected commits by clicking on it.
    - Open the current version of any file that was affected between the selected commits.
    - Copy the path of any file that was affected between the selected commits to the clipboard.
  - Code Review - Keep track of which files you have reviewed in the Commit Details & Comparison Views.
    - Code Review's can be performed on any commit, or between any two commits (not on Uncommitted Changes).
    - When a Code Review is started, all files needing to be reviewed are bolded. When you view the diff / open a file, it will then be un-bolded.
    - Code Reviews persist across Visual Studio Code sessions. They are automatically closed after 90 days of inactivity.
  - View uncommitted changes, and compare the uncommitted changes with any commit.
  - Hover over any commit vertex on the graph to see a tooltip indicating:
    - Whether the commit is included in the HEAD.
    - Which branches, tags and stashes include the commit.
  - Filter the branches shown in Git Graph using the 'Branches' dropdown menu. The options for filtering the branches are:
    - Show All branches
    - Select one or more branches to be viewed
    - Select from a user predefined array of custom glob patterns (by setting `git-graph.customBranchGlobPatterns`)
  - Fetch from Remote(s) _(available on the top control bar)_
  - Find Widget allows you to quickly find one or more commits containing a specific phrase (in the commit message / date / author / hash, branch or tag names).
  - Repository Settings Widget:
    - Allows you to view, add, edit, delete, fetch & prune remotes of the repository.
    - Configure "Issue Linking" - Converts issue numbers in commit messages into hyperlinks, that open the issue in your issue tracking system.
    - Configure "Pull Request Creation" - Automates the opening and pre-filling of a Pull Request form, directly from a branches context menu.
      - Support for the publicly hosted Bitbucket, GitHub and GitLab Pull Request providers is built-in.
      - Custom Pull Request providers can be configured using the Extension Setting `git-graph.customPullRequestProviders` (e.g. for use with privately hosted Pull Request providers). Information on how to configure custom providers is available [here](https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph/wiki/Configuring-a-custom-Pull-Request-Provider).
    - Export your Git Graph Repository Configuration to a file that can be committed in the repository. It allows others working in the same repository to automatically use the same Git Graph configuration.
  - Keyboard Shortcuts (available in the Git Graph View):
    - `CTRL/CMD + F`: Open the Find Widget.
    - `CTRL/CMD + H`: Scrolls the Git Graph View to be centered on the commit referenced by HEAD.
    - `CTRL/CMD + R`: Refresh the Git Graph View.
    - `CTRL/CMD + S`: Scrolls the Git Graph View to the first (or next) stash in the loaded commits.
    - `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + S`: Scrolls the Git Graph View to the last (or previous) stash in the loaded commits.
    - When the Commit Details View is open on a commit:
      - `Up` / `Down`: The Commit Details View will be opened on the commit directly above or below it on the Git Graph View.
      - `CTRL/CMD + Up` / `CTRL/CMD + Down`: The Commit Details View will be opened on its child or parent commit on the same branch.
        - If the Shift Key is also pressed (i.e. `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + Up` / `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + Down`), when branches or merges are encountered the alternative branch is followed.
    - `Enter`: If a dialog is open, pressing enter submits the dialog, taking the primary (left) action.
    - `Escape`: Closes the active dialog, context menu or the Commit Details View.
  - Resize the width of each column, and show/hide the Date, Author & Commit columns.
  - Common Emoji Shortcodes are automatically replaced with the corresponding emoji in commit messages (including all [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/)). Custom Emoji Shortcode mappings can be defined in `git-graph.customEmojiShortcodeMappings`.
- A broad range of configurable settings (e.g. graph style, branch colours, and more...). See the 'Extension Settings' section below for more information.
- "Git Graph" launch button in the Status Bar
- "Git Graph: View Git Graph" launch command in the Command Palette
