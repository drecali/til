- Open the Command Palette with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
- Type the name of the command you're interested in.
- Click the gear-shaped icon that appears when you hover over the command you're interested in. This will open a <kbd>Keyboard Shortcuts</kbd> tab.
- Click the pencil or <kbd>+</kbd> button on the left of the command.
- Press the keyboard shortcut you want to assign. VS Code will tell you if there's already another command with that shortcut.
- Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
- Profit

PS. VS Code allows crazy chorded shortcuts that basically combine 2 shortcuts into 1. I won't go into it because I don't personally use them, but there's loads of info in their [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings). Note that developers also use the term `keybindings`, but that can also mean an entire set of keyboard shortcuts rather than just one individual shortcut. I use the `Keyboard Shortcuts` because everybody recognizes it and VS Code uses it too.
