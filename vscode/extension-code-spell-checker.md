# Code Spell Checker extension is a life saver!

The [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) extension is relatively simple but powerful. It's a spell checker that works with `camelCase` and other cases devs might use.

It's very helpful because some spelling mistakes can be hard to spot if you're not super careful. This eliminates one type of debugging issue ðŸ™‚

You can even download dictionaries for other languages or medical terms.
