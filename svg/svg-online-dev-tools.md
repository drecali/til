# SVG online dev tools

Random SVGs found online or those generated by design programs are not always optimized for web.

[SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) is awesome free, intuitive, and powerful open-source suite of online dev tools! It shows you the markup and the SVG image which can be zoomed in to inspect carefully. It a lot of SVG optimization features and shows you the file size savings and impact on the markup in real time. It's my go-to for all SVG related work. Here are some of its main features.

- prettify markup
- merge styles
- minify styles, colors
- remove comments, empty text, editor data`<title>` or `<desc>`
- merge paths
- and more
