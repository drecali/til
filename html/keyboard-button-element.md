# Keyboard button element

This is great for showing keyboard shortcuts in HTML or Markdown. I didn't know about them for far too long. They're great for documentation!

## Syntax

```html
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Delete</kbd>
```

## Result

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Delete</kbd>

- Hilarious [StackOverflow Q&A](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1939/kbd-elements-are-way-too-intrusive/) about keyboard elements being too much.
