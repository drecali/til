# Best portable laptop stand

As of October 2023, I've been regularly using the same portable laptop stand for over 5 years. I think it's the best because it optimizes:

- **height**: Lifts the screen higher than other portable stands.
- **weight**: Made of plastic so it's very light.
- **stability**: Very stable and doesn't wobble or slide around. It even holds the laptop securely when tilted.
- **packed size**: Very compact when folded.
- **adjustability**: Adjustable to 8 different heights.
- **durability**: I've been using the same stand since 2018 and it's still in great condition.
- **price**: Knockoffs were ~$20 in 2018. The original is more expensive and they keep iterating to improve it.
- **compatibility**: Likely works with all laptops - thick or thin

The original is called the [Roost Stand](https://www.therooststand.com/). A friend bought me a knockoff called the NEXSTAND. As of November 2023, I'm still regularly using it and it's in great condition. There are some origami-style stands that fold flat and are more compact, but they don't usually elevate the screen as much and they're not as stable. That's why I think this is the best portable laptop stand.
