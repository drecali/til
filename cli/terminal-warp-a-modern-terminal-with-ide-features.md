# Warp: a modern terminal with IDE features.

I recently discovered [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/). It feels like a hybrid between a terminal and an IDE. It has nice modern autocomplete, multi-line editing, and more IDE-esque features. It's free for personal use and will have some paid collaboration features. The Warp team say all the core features you'd expect from a terminal will always be free. It's currently Mac only, so sorry Windows and Linux users ðŸ˜¢

## Features

- One of my favorite features they have is [`workflows`](https://www.commands.dev/). It's like a code snippet with built-in documentation. There's a directory of public workflows, and you can make your own private workflows. I'll put an example below.
- Another nice feature is notifications when a long-running command finishes.

Here's the video from their website that shows a few features in action:

## Workflow example

Here's a custom workflow in the wild. The bottom part is the normal input of the terminal. The gray section is the `workflow`.

Here is the code responsible for it. It's just a [YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml) file!

This is actually my version of an existing workflow. I thought the original could be improved so I did it.

```yaml
---
name: "Find all files in a directory that don't contain a string"
command: 'grep -L "{{string}}" {{directory}}'
tags:
  - search
  - grep
description: "Finds all files in a directory that don't contain a given string."
arguments:
  - name: string
    description: The string to search for
    default_value: ~
  - name: directory
    description: The directory to search. Use '*' for current directory.
    default_value: ~
