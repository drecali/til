# `[Terminal]` - Fig: Modern autocomplete for any terminal

The Terminal UX/UI has seen little innovation in the past few decades. IDEs became awesome but terminals stayed pretty much the same.

Until [Fig](https://fig.io/)!

It adds IDE-style autocomplete to any terminal you're already using! I'm a huge fan of it and recommend it to every developer because we deserve nice things too ðŸ™‚

Fig works with all the major terminals and even integrates into VS Code's built-in terminal.

Watch it in action ðŸ‘‡
